# Project Name - CYPHER

## Description: 
* This program encrypts every upper case and lower case alphabet to the 15th position. It leaves every digit, symbol, special character and space the same


## Script Logic
* Collect user input text to be encrypted
* Define the function that will encrypt the text input
* Define shift value to use for encryption
* Define and empty string to be used for the encrypted text
* Define the uppercase and lower case space range of alphabets from the universal ASCII  character set
* Extract all alphabets into lists to ensure each of the 26 alphabets is represented in upper case and lower case
* Loop over the input text input to apply the encryption algorithm
* return encrypted
